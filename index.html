<p> It is a 1a.m. poker game and chords ring from the corner. Two cherubs improvise a song on the spot. The other card-playing cherubs cannot keep straight poker faces through
  the tune.</p>

<p>Oliver Trapp and Danny Jin formed the improvised duo after another cherub recommended they play. With Jin on guitar and Trapp singing, the performance was one of many. Trapp said that performances like this happen every other night. Cherubs came to Evanston with guitars,
  violins and hi-hat drums. </p>

<p>“You have five weeks here, five long weeks,” Trapp said. “And having music is something to bond over with other people and something to share. It’s a great way to pass the time.”</p>

<p>Trapp said improvised performances, or “jam sessions," make the experience better.</p>

<p>“There is a very vibrant musical community,” Trapp said. “You see people on the guitar all the time. We would just jam out for an hour. There is a very visible community of people who enjoy music, who enjoy listening to music, who enjoy playing it.”</p>

<p>Jin developed a reputation for parodies of song covers through many late night jam sessions. He said the community was supportive of his playing.</p>

</div>

<p>“A lot of cherubs appreciate what other cherubs can do with their musical talents,” Jin said. “It’s very enjoyable. When the music sounds good and the lyrics are funny, the parodies are good.”</p>

<p>As for the subject of the parodies, Jin said he’s “afraid that's not pg-13.”</p>

<p>It is difficult to find practice time, but not impossible.</p>


<p>“I usually find time between lectures,” classical violinist Shawna Chen said. “After check-in, I will practice in the observation room. But for the first few weeks, I didn’t have time. It was very hectic.” </p>

<p>Chen recommended cherubs bring instruments.</p>

<p>“If you love it, Bring it,” Chen said. “It’s manageable. You don’t get to play an hour a day, but it was good for me while I was here.” </p>

<p>Chen first picked up the violin at 7 and has been playing since. She said it was worth it to bring the violin to keep “in shape” musically and to relax. Chen is heading for a preforming arts camp right after the program. </p>

<p>“It's a nice way to relieve stress if I’m having writers block and can’t punch out a word,” Chen said. “I’ll pick up the violin and mess around a little bit. It's something I love and can’t say enough about.”</p>

<p>Natasha Roy said she brought her guitar for stress.</p>

<p>“It’s been so much fun to play with everyone,” Roy said. “It’s a good way to get out stress and it’s easier for me to collect my thoughts. It’s a great way to bond with people.”</p>

<p>Roy said she has played with vocalists, guitarists and even a ukulele.</p>

<p>Alex Schwartz was behind the ukulele. Practicing ukulele in his room and casually playing piano in the common room, he said he wished he had brought his music to learn more songs.</p>

<p>Jennifer Kusch, another piano player, said she also wished she brought music to practice.</p>

<p>“It’s just the songs in my memory, but those aren’t the ones I need to be practicing,” Kusch said. “I can pull them up on my phone, it's just really hard to get a good view of what I am playing.”</p>

<p>“The thing I love so much about journalism is that you can tell people’s stories through your writing,” said Jin, “and on music, there are some great writers and they can tell some amazing stories, and I find that connection really beautiful.”</p>
